    <h3>MONKEYS</h3>
    <p>Monkey is a common name that may refer to certain groups or species of simian mammals of infraorder Simiiformes. The term is applied descriptively to groups of primates, such as families of New World monkeys and Old World monkeys. Many monkey species are tree-dwelling (arboreal), although there are species that live primarily on the ground, such as baboons. Most species are mainly active during the day (diurnal). Monkeys are generally considered to be intelligent, especially the Old World monkeys of Catarrhini.</p>
        
     <p>Since Monkeys are very intelligent they are able to continue to adapt to changes in their environment. This is why places where they were once found are now empty. They have had to venture further to find food an shelter in order to survive. The introduction of new species of Monkeys to new locations though can upset the balance of an ecosystem that already exists there so the issues are very complicated to solve.


    Another problem is that with many Monkey species the males have to leave when they reach the age of maturity. In some instances the females do as well. This is all part of nature to make sure that inbreeding isn’t taking place regularly in the groups. However, where are those that leave their place of birth going to go? They have too much competition from aggressive groups that won’t accept anyone else coming in. Too often they die due to predation or a lack of food in the regions where they end up.</p>
        
   <p>The distribution for the Monkey covers may regions around the world. They tend to live in forest regions where they have lots of trees around them. Some of them live in the savannahs though or in the mountain regions. There are species of Monkeys that only live in trees.</p>
